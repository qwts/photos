# M07: Export

**Epic:** [#42](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/42) · **Lane:** Lane B — Core

Lane B. The counterpart to encrypted storage: exporting writes real, openable files. ExportDialog per the design — format segmented (Original/JPEG), **"Decrypt originals" switch on by default; turning it off disables Export and shows the amber warning** ("exported files can't be opened outside Overlook"), destination picker, running progress ("Decrypting & writing" vs "Writing"), done summary. Entry points: multi-select action pill and the lightbox export icon (count=1).

## Issues

| # | Title | Blocked by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [#97](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/97) | Export engine: decrypt + write originals with progress | #67, #70 |
| [#98](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/98) | JPEG transcode export path | #97, #86 |
| [#99](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/99) | ExportDialog: format, decrypt switch, destination, progress | #97, #59, #60, #61 |
| [#100](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/100) | Export entry points: selection action pill + lightbox | #99, #78, #92 |
| [#101](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/101) | E2E: select → export → decrypted files on disk | #100 |

## Acceptance coverage

| Flow | Status | Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Export engine: stream-decrypt to destination, collision suffixes, statfs preflight, partial cleanup, serialized runs, cancel-keeps-completed | ✅ #97 (PR #194) | `tests/export/export-engine.test.ts` (real store, byte-identical) |
| JPEG transcode (q90, EXIF stripped per ADR-0006, all RAW kinds via preview policy) | ✅ #98 (PR #195) | `tests/export/export-engine.test.ts` |
| ExportDialog (decrypt-off ⇒ disabled + warning, phases on engine events, cancelled-aware done copy) | ✅ #99 (PR #197) | `ExportDialog.stories.tsx` play tests + `tests/e2e/export-flow.spec.ts` — ledger id `m07-export-dialog` |
| Entry points: pill + lightbox with exact counts, selection preserved | ✅ #100 (PR #198) | `tests/e2e/export-entry.spec.ts` — ledger id `m07-export-entry-points` |
| Acceptance: select→export→files on disk (sha256-vs-contentHash byte fidelity) + full-circle RAF import → JPEG export | ✅ #101 (PR #199) | `tests/e2e/export-flow.spec.ts` |

Recorded decisions: v1 ships no encrypted-export format (decrypt-off just disables Export); transcode quality 90; EXIF/GPS stripped on transcode — metadata travels only with Original exports.
