// process state and recent renderer console output) instead of silently
// consuming the whole test budget. Teardown is bounded and force-kill-backed:
// a timed-out test can no longer leave app.close() hanging into Playwright's
// worker-teardown timeout, which used to replace the original failure with an
// unowned "Worker teardown timeout" error that kept the gate red even when
// the retry passed.

// Stage bounds. Generous relative to healthy runs (launch ≈1s, ready ≈1s on a
// dev machine) but far below any test budget, so a missed transition fails
// fast with a diagnosis. These are readiness bounds, not product timings — do
// not tune product behavior against them.
