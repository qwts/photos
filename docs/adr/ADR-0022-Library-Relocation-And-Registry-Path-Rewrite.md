# ADR-0022: Library Relocation and Registry Path Rewrite

## Status

Accepted 2026-07-19 on issue [#483](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/483)
(proposed and owner-accepted the same day; any section may still be amended by
owner veto before its implementing code lands). This ADR extends
[ADR-0017](./ADR-0017-Multi-Library-Registry-Keying-And-Lifecycle.md) (registry §1,
identity §2, teardown §4, locking and path health §5) and applies the
staging-and-atomic-activation discipline of
[ADR-0010](./ADR-0010-Cloud-Restore-Staging-And-Atomic-Activation.md) to the local
filesystem; it rewrites neither. §3 below is this ADR's one explicit amendment
to ADR-0017 §2.

Section map for [#483](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/483): §1–§2 govern
the relocation service and its journal, §3–§4 the staging identity rule and the
copy/verify/commit protocol, §5 preflight and refusals, §6 external-volume
behavior, §7 multi-library moves.

## Context

- **The registry has no relocation operation.** `LibraryRegistry` exposes
  `register` / `remove` / `updateId` / `rename` / `touchOpened` — nothing
  rewrites an entry's `path` (`src/main/library/library-registry.ts:35-125`).
  Manually moving a directory strands its entry, and the only repair is the
  picker's Locate flow (ADR-0017 §5, #386). #483 requires an in-app move.
- **ADR-0017 already decided most of what a move needs.** Identity travels with
  the directory (`library-id` is authoritative, §2;
  `src/main/library/library-id.ts:21`); the anti-rollback anchor is keyed by
  the library ULID precisely so it survives path changes (§3); a clean close
  checkpoints WAL so the closed directory is a complete, copy-safe unit (§4;
  `src/main/index.ts:695-701`); the advisory lock and missing-path handling
  exist (§5; `src/main/library/library-lock.ts:111`). Relocation composes this
  machinery — it is not new identity or lifecycle design.
- **But ADR-0017 §2 forbids the state a safe move requires.** §2 bans two
  directories carrying one ULID and forces an explicit moved-vs-copy choice
  when one is discovered. A copy-based move deliberately creates that state
  between first copied byte and source cleanup. Without a decided carve-out,
  the #386 locate/add flow and the #483 relocation service contradict each
  other, and crash recovery cannot tell relocation staging from a user's copy.
- **ADR-0010 already solved this shape for cloud restore**: sibling staging, a
  checkpoint bound to library identity, verify-before-activate, rename-based
  activation, and startup recovery of stranded directories. Relocation is that
  discipline run disk-to-disk with no provider in the loop.
- **Staging can never be registered.** The registry schema rejects duplicate
  ids at parse time (`src/shared/library/registry.ts:29-37`), so staging
  recognition must work from the filesystem and a journal, outside the
  registry.

## Decision

### 1. Relocation is a main-process registry transaction

- A journaled relocation service lives below the renderer in the main process;
  the renderer drives it only through new zod-validated channels in the IPC
  registry (`src/shared/ipc/channels.ts`). There is no renderer patch surface.
- The registry gains exactly one new mutation: an atomic **path rewrite**
  (`updatePath(id, newPath)` shape) using ADR-0017 §1 mechanics (main-owned,
  temp-file + rename). The source entry stays registered and **authoritative
  for the entire move**; the rewrite is the commit point and runs only after
  full verification (§4). What a registered path *means* is unchanged — it is
  the library's one authoritative location; relocation adds a governed
  transition between two such locations.
- Relocation is local filesystem work. It never uploads, downloads,
  re-imports, re-encrypts, or deduplicates. The library ULID, the
  `/Overlook/<library-id>/` remote namespace, provider auth, backup ledgers,
  and custody records are untouched (ADR-0007/ADR-0013 unchanged); the anchor
  survives because it is ULID-keyed, not path-keyed (ADR-0017 §3).

### 2. Journal and staging marker

- Each move writes a relocation journal at
  `userData/relocations/<libraryId>.json` — main-owned, `version: 1`
  strict-schema, atomic temp-file + rename (the restore-checkpoint
  conventions, `src/main/backup/restore-staging.ts:9-38`), **fail-loud** like
  the registry (never self-healing; ADR-0017 §1's rationale). It records
  `{version, libraryId, sourcePath, destPath, stagingPath, mode, state}` with
  states `copying → verified → committed → cleaned` (`mode` is copy vs
  same-volume rename, §4). Unlike the restore checkpoint it lives in the
  profile root, not inside staging: recovery must still run when the
  destination volume is unplugged, so the journal cannot live on it.
- Staging is a sibling of the final destination **on the destination volume**,
  named `<finalDir>.relocate-staging` (parallel to ADR-0010's
  `library.restore-staging`), so activation is a same-volume atomic rename.
  Staging carries a marker file `relocation.json` binding it to its journal
  (library ULID + journal nonce). **The marker, not the directory name,
  defines staging**: it travels through the activation rename, so a crash
  between activation and commit leaves the final-path directory still
  marker-bound and therefore still staging (§3) — the source stays
  authoritative and resume-or-discard applies. The marker is deleted
  immediately after the registry commit; a crash in that window resolves from
  the `committed` journal plus the registry already pointing at the
  destination.
- Startup recovery reads journals, not guesses: pre-commit states resume or
  discard staging; a `committed` journal with a surviving source finishes
  cleanup; disk state matching no journal is never silently acted on.

### 3. Amendment to ADR-0017 §2 — relocation staging is not a second library

ADR-0017 §2's rule — the same ULID at two still-existing paths forces an
explicit moved-vs-copy choice — applies to **user-visible library
directories**. A directory carrying a relocation marker that matches a live
journal is relocation staging: it is never listed, never offered to add or
Locate, never triggers the moved-vs-copy dialog, and is only ever resumed or
discarded by §2's recovery. A marker with no matching journal makes the
directory inert — surfaced as a repair/cleanup action, never treated as a
library. The two-writer prohibition itself is unchanged: staging never opens
for writing and never contacts the remote; the source remains the sole writer
until commit.

### 4. Copy → verify → commit → cleanup protocol

Ordered; every numbered boundary is a crash/cancel test point (#483
acceptance 6):

1. **Quiesce.** Active library: the full ADR-0017 §4 teardown — fence →
   cancel/drain → WAL checkpoint → close → zero keys → release lock
   (`closeLibrary`, `src/main/index.ts:669`). Inactive library: take its
   advisory lock (`src/main/library/library-lock.ts:111`); refuse if live-held
   by another instance (§5).
2. **Copy** the closed, checkpointed directory into staging. Bytes are copied
   as-is; nothing decrypts and no plaintext is persisted.
3. **Verify**: every file by relative path, size, and SHA-256 digest (the
   house algorithm — ADR-0010's manifest binding, ADR-0013's anchor hash; the
   marker file is excluded from the comparison set); the staged `library-id`
   equals the entry id; the staged database opens with the existing key
   custody (read-only health check), then closes.
4. **Activate**: rename staging → final destination (same-volume, atomic).
   The marker travels with it (§2).
5. **Commit**: the atomic registry path rewrite (§1), then delete the marker.
   Before this step the source is authoritative; after it, the destination
   is.
6. **Reopen** and health-check the destination when the active library moved —
   with the same full renderer reset as a switch (ADR-0017 §4).
7. **Cleanup**: remove the source. Failure here leaves two verified copies;
   the journal stays `committed`, the UI reports both paths and offers safe
   retry — the app never guesses which copy to delete.

Cancellation, crash, volume disconnection, full disk, I/O error, or
verification failure at or before step 5 leaves the original library
registered and usable; recovery (§2) discards or resumes staging.

**Optimized same-volume rename** is permitted only as steps 2–4 collapsed into
one `rename(source → finalDir)`, with the journal recording the intent
*before* the rename: a crash between rename and commit is then repaired from
the journal (complete the commit, or reverse the rename — the journal wins).
The guarantee set must be identical to the copy path; cross-volume moves
always copy.

### 5. Preflight and refusals

- Preflight runs before any bytes move: destination writability, free space
  (library size plus scratch), path collision — never create over, merge into,
  or overwrite a non-empty directory or any registered path — source
  readability, and filesystem support. Failures map to stable, user-showable
  reasons (ADR-0010's discipline).
- Network-mount destinations get ADR-0017 §5's unsupported-but-not-blocked
  treatment: strong warning plus the advisory-lock caveat. Anything stronger
  is a new decision (ADR amendment).
- An inactive library whose lock is live-held by another instance refuses to
  move; same-hostname dead-pid locks are stale and reclaimable per
  ADR-0017 §5.
- **Cloud backup is advisory, never a gate.** The §4 guarantees hold with or
  without a backup: at every instant one verified authoritative copy exists,
  and the only destructive step runs after two copies verify. Requiring an
  active, fully-synced backup would couple a local, offline-capable operation
  to network availability and an optional feature — and a blocked user's
  fallback is a manual Finder move with no verification or journal, the exact
  hazard #483 exists to remove. Preflight instead **reports** backup posture
  in the confirmation UI: active and current; active with N items pending
  (recommend letting backup finish first); or not configured (one-line
  advisory). Nothing blocks. A backup run in flight is quiesced by §4 step 1
  like any other service — the sync ledger preserves its intent across the
  move, and the unchanged ULID (§1) leaves the remote namespace untouched.

### 6. External-volume behavior

- Extends ADR-0017 §5 missing-path handling: the derived `missing` status
  distinguishes volume-unmounted from path-gone, and the picker adds
  **Reconnect volume** beside **Locate**. Locate keeps §2's ULID verification
  (accept the matching id, reject any other).
- A missing library is never re-created empty (the #385 fail-loud rule) and
  never routes to cloud restore: restore stays an explicit user action
  (ADR-0009/ADR-0010). A disconnected disk is not data loss.
- Volume removal during copy, verify, or open aborts before commit — the
  source stays authoritative. Stable remount paths are supported to the
  extent the OS provides them; a changed mount path surfaces an actionable
  error, never a silent re-point.

### 7. Multi-library moves

A multi-select move is N independent single-library relocations sharing a
destination root — one collision-safe directory per library, one journal per
library, independent progress and per-library results. There is no
cross-library transaction: one library's failure never rolls back another's
commit.

## Consequences

- **Easier**: relocation composes already-accepted machinery — identity (§2),
  ULID-keyed anchor (§3), universal teardown (§4), advisory locks and
  missing-path status (§5) from ADR-0017, plus ADR-0010's staging discipline —
  so the new surface is one registry mutation, one journal, and the copy
  engine. Nothing provider- or remote-side changes at all.
- **Harder**: a second journaled-recovery surface (relocation journals) now
  exists beside restore staging and must be honored at startup; the §3 staging
  exemption must be enforced everywhere directories are scanned (picker
  add/locate, startup selection); the two-verified-copies end state needs
  honest UX, not auto-deletion.
- **Deferred, with owners**:
  - Moving the profile itself (`userData`, registry included) — out of scope;
    a new decision if ever wanted.
  - Locate-after-reinstall ([#479](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/479))
    shares §6's identity-safe Locate but is its own issue.
  - Depth of network-share support stays where ADR-0017 §5 left it — warning
    plus advisory lock; revisiting needs an ADR amendment.
- **Revisit when**: semantic-search indexes
  ([#379](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/379)) or face data
  ([#285](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/285)) land inside the library
  directory — a whole-directory copy carries them automatically, but their
  services must join ADR-0017 §4's drain table before an active-library move
  can quiesce them.
