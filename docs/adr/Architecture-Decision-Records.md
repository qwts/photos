# Architecture Decision Records

Canonical architecture decision records for photos. ADRs live **only** in this
wiki (no repo copies). They are appended, never rewritten — a superseding
decision gets a new ADR that links back to the one it replaces.

## Template

New ADRs use the next sequential number and this structure:

```markdown
# ADR-NNNN: Title

## Status

Proposed | Accepted | Superseded by `[ADR-MMMM](./ADR-MMMM-Title.md)`

## Context

What forces are at play; why a decision is needed now.

## Decision

The decision, stated actively ("We will …").

## Consequences

What becomes easier, what becomes harder, what must be revisited and when.
```

Add the new ADR to the index table above and link it from any affected pages.
