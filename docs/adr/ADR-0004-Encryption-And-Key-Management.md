# ADR-0004: Encryption & Key Management

## Status

Accepted (proposed 2026-07-12 on issue [#65](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/65); accepted under the owner's standing work-through-M11 authorization after an open review window — any section may still be amended by owner veto before its implementing code lands)

## Context

Overlook stores originals "encrypted with your key" and the design surfaces
`AES-256 · GCM · KEY #2` in the Inspector — encryption at rest is a product
invariant that "cannot be disabled", not a feature flag. Every M03 crypto
sub-issue needs a recorded scheme to cite instead of re-deciding: cipher and
envelope, key hierarchy, custody, recovery, and whether the database itself is
encrypted. The design handoff's sibling product (Image Trail) uses
password-wrapped PBKDF2 → AES-GCM envelopes; Overlook is a desktop app with an
OS keychain available, so its custody model can be stronger than a password.

## Decision

**Blob encryption — AES-256-GCM streaming envelopes.** Originals and derived
images are encrypted in 4 MiB chunks. Each chunk is sealed with AES-256-GCM;
the nonce is a random 64-bit per-blob prefix + 32-bit chunk counter (nonce
reuse impossible within a key's lifetime at our volumes). AAD binds each chunk
to `photo id + key id + chunk index`, and the final chunk carries a
total-chunk-count marker so truncation is detectable. Integrity: the GCM tag
per chunk, plus the SHA-256 content hash of the plaintext original stored in
the database (also the blob-store address, ADR-0005).

ADR-0013 protected domains use the same authenticated streaming envelope but
replace the ordinary photo context with `protected album id + opaque blob ref +
derivative kind`. Their address is HMAC-SHA-256 under the album key over the
plaintext hash, so equality is visible only inside one authorized album. The
ordinary plaintext hash remains sealed protected metadata and never becomes a
protected filesystem or provider address.

**Key hierarchy — master key → versioned library keys.**

- A random 256-bit **master key** exists once per library. It never touches
  the database; it only wraps other keys.
- Versioned 256-bit **library keys** (`KEY #1`, `KEY #2`, … — the ids the
  Inspector shows) are stored in the `keys` table wrapped by the master key.
  Blobs record the key id that sealed them.
- **Rotation (v1):** creating a new library key makes it the write key — new
  imports and re-encrypts use it. Existing blobs stay on their original key
  and are **not** lazily re-encrypted in v1; rotation limits future exposure,
  it does not retroactively re-seal history. Recorded plainly so the Inspector
  copy stays honest.

**Master-key custody — OS keychain via Electron `safeStorage`, with a
required recovery phrase.**

- The master key is wrapped by `safeStorage` (Keychain on macOS, DPAPI on
  Windows, secret service on Linux) and stored in the library directory.
- **Linux caveat:** when no secret service is available `safeStorage` falls
  back to weak obfuscation. Overlook detects this
  (`safeStorage.isEncryptionAvailable()`), warns explicitly, and refuses to
  describe the library as keychain-protected — factual security copy, never
  marketing.
- **Recovery (v1): a recovery phrase is generated at library creation** —
  BIP39-style words encoding the master key — shown once with instructions to
  store it offline. This is not optional polish: restoring a pCloud backup on
  a new machine has no OS keychain to read, so a portable key path must exist
  for backup to mean anything. Stated plainly in-product: _"Lose the keychain
  and the phrase, and the library cannot be decrypted. There is no other
  recovery."_

**Database at rest — whole-DB encryption (SQLCipher family).** Filenames,
EXIF, GPS coordinates, and places are exactly as sensitive as pixels; a
plaintext catalog next to encrypted blobs leaks most of what matters.
Field-level encryption would destroy indexing and querying (no index over an
encrypted `place`). The database is SQLCipher-encrypted
(`better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers` or equivalent — final module choice rides
ADR-0006's native-module policy), keyed by a DB key wrapped by the master key.

**Threat model (v1), stated per the security-copy voice:**

- **Protects against:** device theft / disk imaging (everything at rest is
  ciphertext); the backup provider (pCloud holds only client-side-encrypted
  bytes); other OS users without the keychain session.
- **Does not protect against:** a compromised OS or session (keys are in
  process memory while the app runs); an attacker with the recovery phrase;
  traffic/size analysis by the backup provider (blob count and sizes are
  visible).

## Consequences

- M03 sub-issues implement against named sections here (envelope, `keys`
  table, custody, recovery) instead of debating scheme choices in PRs.
- The recovery-phrase flow becomes a hard requirement of library creation
  (M03) and of backup restore (M08) — UI copy for it must follow the design
  system's factual security voice.
- SQLCipher pulls the database driver into ADR-0006's native-module policy
  (prebuilds, Electron ABI, exact pins); if that policy rules the SQLCipher
  variant out, this ADR must be revisited **before** M03 starts, not worked
  around silently.
- Chunked GCM means streaming import/export without whole-file buffering, at
  the cost of a small per-chunk overhead (16-byte tag per 4 MiB).
- Lazy re-encryption after rotation is explicitly deferred; if it becomes a
  requirement, it arrives as a new ADR amending the rotation section.

## Accepted deviations & review notes

Appended after the M11 security review ([#129](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/129);
full write-up: [Security Review M11](../Security-Review-M11.md)). The review found the
crypto, IPC, and plaintext-at-rest seams **sound and well-tested** against this
ADR's threat model; the notes below record where the implementation's guarantee
is weaker than the prose above, with the accepted position.

- **Nonce uniqueness is probabilistic, not enforced (accepted for v0.x).** The
  "nonce reuse impossible within a key's lifetime at our volumes" claim in the
  _Blob encryption_ section rests on a **64-bit random per-blob prefix**
  (`envelope.ts` `nonceFor`), so uniqueness is a birthday bound (N²/2⁶⁵ under
  one key), not an invariant: negligible (~2⁻²²) at a few million blobs/key,
  ~1/130k by ~16M, 50% at 2³². Rotation resets the per-key population, which is
  the practical mitigation. **Accepted** for single-user libraries at realistic
  photo volumes; **not release-blocking**. Hardening (a persisted per-key blob
  budget that forces rotation, or a monotonic counter as the nonce fixed field
  for a deterministic-unique construction) is tracked in
  [#229](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/229) and must land before
  libraries can approach ~2³⁰ blobs/key. The prose above is left intact per the
  append-only convention; this note is the correction of record.
- **Counter overflow is loud, not silent.** `nonceFor` writes the 32-bit
  counter with `writeUInt32BE`; a chunk index ≥ 2³² throws rather than wrapping
  into a reused nonce. Unreachable per blob (2³² × 4 MiB ≈ 16 EB) but confirmed
  fail-loud.
- **No unverified-plaintext release.** Each whole chunk is buffered before
  decrypt and pushed only after `decipher.final()` authenticates — the classic
  streaming-GCM release-before-verify pitfall is avoided. Truncation, chunk
  reorder/drop, cross-photo/cross-key substitution, and post-final extension all
  fail closed (AAD binds photoId + keyId + chunkIndex + flags + totalChunks on
  every chunk).
- **Dev seams fail closed in packaged builds.** `OVERLOOK_INSECURE_KEYSTORE`
  was already gated on `!app.isPackaged`. The M11 review (F1) extended the same
  gate to the remaining harness env hooks (seed / synthetic-seed / fixture
  import & export dirs / injected backup faults / profile override) via a single
  `harnessEnv()` accessor, so a **packaged app is not steerable via env**. The
  master key is persisted only through `safeStorage`; there is no plaintext key
  fallback (custody refuses to run without an OS keychain).
- **DB key is pinned to KEY #1** (`index.ts`) independent of blob-write-key
  rotation — matches the "rotation only moves the blob write key" decision
  above; noted so the rotation story stays honest. Not a finding.
