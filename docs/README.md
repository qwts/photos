# photos Documentation

This directory holds photos' canonical process, planning, and SOP
documentation. It is the source of truth: docs are versioned with the code they
describe, reviewed in the same pull request, and findable by GitHub code search
(see
[ENG-0003](https://github.com/qwts/playbook-software-engineering/blob/master/docs/decisions/ENG-0003-repo-is-documentation-source-of-truth.md)).

The GitHub wiki is retired. Its pages are stubs pointing here, kept only so
existing links resolve — never add content there.

## Layout

- [`adr/`](./adr/) — architecture decision records and their index
- [`acceptance/`](./acceptance/) — acceptance and manual test plans
- [`stories/`](./stories/) — user stories and milestone planning

## Maintenance Convention

- Detailed process/SOP/planning docs live **here**; root-level repo files
  (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README.md`) stay compact
  entrypoints that link here.
- Doc updates ship **in the same pull request** as the change that makes them
  true — a change altering workflow, testing strategy, or architecture updates
  the page in the same unit of work, not after the fact.
- ADRs are appended, never rewritten; superseding decisions get a new ADR that
  links back.
