# Repo Documentation Pointer Map

This page maps repository markdown documentation to its canonical home, so
nothing is duplicated. All documentation now lives in this repository under
`docs/`; the GitHub wiki is retired and its pages are stubs pointing here, kept
only so existing issue, PR, and comment links continue to resolve.

| Repository path                   | Canonical home                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `README.md`                       | Canonical in the repository (quickstart + script table)                                            |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md`                 | Pointer stub → [Contributing](./Contributing.md)                                                   |
| `AGENTS.md`                       | Shared agent-context file (repo-canonical); long-form workflow → [Contributing](./Contributing.md) |
| `CLAUDE.md`                       | Claude Code orientation pointing into `AGENTS.md` (repo-canonical)                                 |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Copilot review orientation pointing into `AGENTS.md` (repo-canonical)                              |
| `.claude/commands/check.md`       | `/check` command wrapping the local gate run (repo-canonical)                                      |
| ADRs                              | [Architecture Decision Records](./adr/Architecture-Decision-Records.md) — index + template         |
| User-story / milestone planning   | [User Stories](./stories/User-Stories.md)                                                          |
| Testing strategy                  | [Testing Strategy](./Testing-Strategy.md)                                                          |

## Rules

- New process/SOP/planning docs go **in `docs/`** and get a row here only if a
  repo stub exists or is needed for discoverability.
- Update the `docs/` page behind a stub, never the stub itself.
- When adding a repo pointer stub, keep it compact: title, one-line description,
  link, and "update the `docs/` page, not this stub."
