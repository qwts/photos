## TL;DR

- **Local "before done" gate:** `npm run ci` = lint suite + `format:check` +
  `test:cov` (unit + renderer DOM) + `build` — the same non-browser gates CI
  runs.
- **CI runs everything** on every PR to `main` and every push to `main`,
  including the coverage floor and the Playwright E2E lane (path-filtered).
- **Floors ratchet upward only:** c8 lines 90 / branches 80 (`.c8rc.json`),
  type-coverage 99.8 strict, file-size budget 800 lines. The **a11y violation
  budget** (`tests/a11y/violation-budget.json`, #398) is the same policy
  inverted — its counts only ever **shrink**.
- **Policy:** coverage travels with the change — a new or changed user-facing
  flow lands with tests at the cheapest lane that proves the behavior.

### Compile-then-run model

Unit tests run against compiled JS: `tsconfig.test.json` emits unit-testable
sources (`src/shared/` + `tests/`, `jsx: react-jsx` ready for future `.tsx`)
to `.test-dist/`, then `node --test` runs the output — no loader magic.
**The unit runtime is Electron's own Node** (`ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 electron
--test`, #72): native modules in `node_modules` carry the Electron ABI
(`postinstall` = `electron-builder install-app-deps`), so one ABI serves the
unit lane and the app — plain `node` cannot load the drivers. Electron's
major is capped by driver-prebuild availability (ADR-0006 prebuilt-only;
Dependabot ignore records the removal condition). E2E
builds the app once in `tests/e2e/global-setup.ts` (concurrent builds would
clobber each other's output).

### Electron multi-process gate coverage (#51)

The Electron layout (`src/main` / `src/preload` / `src/renderer` /
`src/shared`, ADR-0003) is fully inside the static gates: per-process strict
tsconfigs (`npm run typecheck` runs all four projects), type-aware ESLint with
react-hooks + `@eslint-react` on the renderer, `no-restricted-imports`
enforcing the process-boundary matrix (CLAUDE.md §Architecture), madge over
`ts,tsx`, knip via its electron-vite plugin, per-project `type-coverage`.

**c8 scope:** `src/main/` and `src/shared/` remain floored by the unit lane.
Renderer components join the same global floor when they receive DOM-lane
coverage; `.c8rc.json` lists the admitted renderer files explicitly so adding
an untested surface cannot silently lower the project floor. `src/preload/`
and unlisted renderer process wiring are exercised by Playwright-Electron
instead. Floor values are unchanged (ratchet intact).

### Renderer DOM lane (#135)

- `tests/dom/tsconfig.json` extends the renderer project (`Bundler`, DOM libs,
  `vite/client`) and emits tests plus imported renderer modules to
  `.test-dist-dom/`.
- `tests/dom/register.ts` runs through `node --import`, installs happy-dom, and
  registers the CSS-module hook before test discovery. Tests import the actual
  renderer components; they do not replace CSS or the component with a test
  double.
- `npm run test:dom` is the focused compile-and-run command. `npm test` and
  `npm run test:cov` compile and run both the Node unit lane and this DOM lane.

### Playwright-Electron caveats (#52)

- `_electron` is marked **experimental** by Playwright — pin-bumps of
  `@playwright/test` (Dependabot) can move it; a red E2E lane after a
  Playwright bump should suspect the API first.
- Each test launches its own app instance from `out/` (hermetic, ~1s cost);
  global-setup builds once. `electron.launch({ args: ['.'] })` resolves the
  Electron binary from `node_modules` and the entry from `package.json#main`.
- Local macOS Electron windows are hidden by default so the suite does not take
  keyboard focus. This is a real rendered `BrowserWindow` with background
  throttling disabled, not Chromium headless mode. Linux keeps the window
  visible inside Xvfb because hidden Chromium windows can report zero layout
  geometry. Native attention requests such as `second-instance`, `open-file`,
  and Dock activation still deliver their application events in the hidden
  harness, but must not restore, show, or focus its window. This focus-safety
  invariant is covered at the policy boundary and in the external-open E2E
  flows. Use
  `npm run test:e2e:visible` for native-window debugging; a lifecycle-dependent
  spec can set `OVERLOOK_E2E_WINDOW=visible` in its launch environment.
  The performance lane always uses a visible native window so its frame and
  scroll budgets remain representative. Packaged builds ignore the harness flag.
- On CI (ubuntu) Electron needs OS libraries (`npx playwright install-deps`)
  and a display server — the E2E step runs under `xvfb-run`. No browser
  download: Electron carries its own Chromium.
- The `webServer`/`baseURL` fixture mechanism is gone; there is no port to
  collide on, so parallel workers stay safe.
- **Launch/readiness/teardown go through the shared `launchOverlook` fixture**
  (`tests/e2e/support/app.ts`): staged, individually-bounded launch readiness
  with stage-labeled stalls, and a bounded force-kill-backed close so a
  timed-out test cannot escalate into an unowned worker-teardown timeout.
  In-place reloads use `expectRendererReload`. Every wall-clock wait in the
  suite is inventoried and classified in the
  [E2E & Storybook Timing Audit](./E2E-Timing-Audit.md) (#630); add new timing
  waits there in the same PR. A timeout increase requires naming the stalled
  condition — never a blanket raise.
- The CI E2E command is wrapped by `scripts/measure-runner-capacity.mjs`, which
  samples normalized host load, available memory, and Linux CPU/I/O pressure
  while the guarded test entrypoint runs. Manual CI dispatches can compare one,
  two, and three workers with retries disabled; each run retains a
  `runner-capacity-*` evidence artifact. The ordinary required lane remains at
  three workers and two retries unless same-SHA measurements justify a change.

## What runs when & where

### Local — the "before done" gate

```sh
npm run ci        # lint suite, format:check, test:cov, build
npm run test:dom  # focused renderer DOM compile + tests
npm run test:e2e  # additionally, for E2E-relevant changes
npm run test:e2e:visible -- tests/e2e/example.spec.ts  # brief visible debug run
```

The pre-commit hook (husky + lint-staged) auto-fixes staged files
(`eslint --fix` + prettier) but runs no tests — CI owns the full gate.

### CI — `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

On every PR to `main` and push to `main` (post-merge signal):

1. `lint` (full chain) → `format:check` → `test:cov` (unit + renderer DOM, with
   `node-test-github-reporter` annotations) → coverage summary + lcov artifact →
   `build` → Storybook interaction tests (`test:stories:ci`, chromium)
2. **E2E job** (parallel, own runner): path-filtered by `dorny/paths-filter` —
   docs-only PRs skip it; always runs on main pushes. Chromium via Playwright,
   `test:e2e`, HTML report artifact (14-day retention), and runner-capacity
   evidence (30-day retention).
3. **`E2E gate`** — the stable required check: green on E2E success or a
   legitimate filter skip; red if change detection itself failed. The branch
   ruleset requires **this job**, never `E2E` directly.
4. **`e2e-report`** — on E2E failure only: publishes the HTML report (traces,
   screenshots, videos) to Pages at a stable per-PR URL,
   `https://qwts.github.io/photos/reports/pr-<number>/`, with freshness check,
   serialized gh-pages pushes, and a Pages verify/self-heal step.

There is no scheduled/nightly run — all automation is PR-triggered, with one
manual exception:

### Packaging lane (manual, #53)

`npm run package` (electron-builder, unsigned: mac dmg+zip, win nsis) is
deliberately **not** in the PR gate — it is the slow lane. The **Package**
workflow (`workflow_dispatch`) builds unsigned mac + win artifacts on demand;
run it when packaging risk changes (Electron bumps, native modules, builder
config). electron-builder's `npmRebuild` stays on and native modules must land
in `dependencies` so the rebuild mechanism engages when better-sqlite3/sharp
arrive (M03, ADR-0006's prebuilt-only policy). Signing/notarization is M11.

### Perf baselines (manual, #74)

Recorded baselines live next to the lane that produces them; re-record when
the machinery they measure changes.

| Baseline         | How                                                                                                                                           | Result (2026-07-12, Apple Silicon dev machine)                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200K keyset page | unit lane prints `[baseline] 200K keyset page`                                                                                                | 0.4 ms                                                                  |
| 200K grid scroll | `npm run seed:perf` boots a 200,000-row synthetic profile; the grid's frame monitor exposes `globalThis.__overlookFrameStats` while scrolling | 557 frames observed, 0 dropped (>25 ms), worst 9.4 ms; 36 cells mounted |

The E2E lane keeps a fast 2,000-row variant of the same path
(`tests/e2e/grid.spec.ts`) so windowing + cursor paging stay covered per-PR;
the 200K run is manual because seeding takes ~17 s.

### Perf budgets (#123 — RATCHETS: tighten, never loosen)

The harness: `npm run test:perf` (own Playwright config, ~90 s;
never a per-PR gate) or the manual CI lane (`perf.yml`, `workflow_dispatch`).
It runs the 200K synthetic profile as a SETTLED library (synced ledger rows —
born-dirty scale rows poisoned pending counts and doomed backups; recorded),
measures the table below, writes `test-results/perf-report.json`, and asserts
the budgets in `tests/perf/budgets.ts` (the enforced copy of this table).
Cold start is measured on a RELAUNCH of the already-seeded profile — the
product case, not the one-time synthetic insert. Budgets are ratchets and are
never loosened to absorb variance; CI numbers are indicative, while the
recorded baselines are the dev machine's.

Scroll measurements run three visible native-BrowserWindow trials at every
zoom. The report retains each trial's frames, drops, drop rate, and worst frame;
the drop-rate budget gates the median trial and the worst-frame budget gates the
maximum across trials. An incomplete trial set fails closed. This reduces
single-run scheduler noise without hiding a repeated regression or relaxing a
budget.

#124 outcomes: `counts()` rewritten as ONE FILTER-clause pass over the
ledger join (689 → 378 ms; ratchet tightened to 500 ms). Zoom-96 scroll
drops (~0.20, worst frame 68 ms) stay within the 0.30 budget; the obvious
lever — letting Chromium disk-cache decoded thumbs — is REJECTED on privacy
grounds (decrypted bytes never hit disk, ADR-0004), so further tightening
waits for an in-memory decode pool (recorded).

#432 removed a React rerender from every unavailable-thumbnail load failure.
That path dominates the metadata-only 200K profile at 96px: the final corrected
implementation passed at 0.2581 median while preserving the visible and
screen-reader `PREVIEW UNAVAILABLE` fallback, and successful previews retain no
stale fallback text. The three-trial measurement contract above records the
remaining variance instead of lowering the 0.30 ratchet.

### Coverage-map distribution (#126 sweep, 2026-07-13)

The full design README screen/interaction inventory maps to 33 ledger
entries: **31 automated** (32 playwright-e2e, 13 storybook, 11 unit-dom
coverages), **1 manual-with-reason** (motion timings / hover fills /
disabled opacity — visual-only rules; the disabled PATTERN is exercised by
component stories), and **1 deferred-with-issue** for the design README's
"not yet designed" set: semantic search results UI (#224). Zero unmapped flows; the validator
enforces shape, path existence, and that deferred entries carry issues.

### Accessibility gates (#398 — RATCHET: shrink, never raise)

WCAG 2.2 AA is the bar (epic #381). Three gates, two of which need a browser:

| Gate                        | Where                                                  | What it catches                                                                                                                                                |

| `npm run lint:contrast`     | `npm run lint` inside `npm run ci`                     | Declared semantic token pairs: 4.5:1 normal text and 3:1 UI/status contrast, using the shared WCAG luminance module consumed by theme validation.              |
| axe per story               | `test:stories:ci` (existing chromium runner, +0 lanes) | Component-level violations across all 107 stories, scoped to `#storybook-root`.                                                                                |

**The budget** (`tests/a11y/violation-budget.json`) is the honest list of KNOWN
violations, keyed by story id / flow id, each naming the issue that owns the fix.

- **Counts are keyed by axe rule id, never totalled.** A bare total is not a
  ratchet: a surface budgeted `1× color-contrast` could be "fixed" into
  `1× button-name` and still sum to 1, hiding a fresh regression behind existing
  debt. Verdicts compare rule-by-rule (PR #408 review).
- **Unlisted surfaces are budgeted at ZERO** — a new violation anywhere fails
  without anyone remembering to add an entry.
- **Under budget also fails.** An unrecorded improvement leaves a stale number that
  silently permits regression back up to it. The failure message names the value to
  set; drop a rule at zero, and delete the entry when its last rule goes.
- **Orphaned entries fail.** Both lanes record which ids they audited
  (`--visited` after `test:stories:ci`; a closure test in `a11y.spec.ts`), because
  path existence cannot catch a renamed story export — the file survives, so the
  static check passes while the runtime lane stops evaluating that id.
- Fix the violation or shrink the entry. **Never raise one, and never narrow the
  `tags`** — the tag set is pinned in the budget and re-checked by the validator.

**`axe-core` is pinned exact and overridden into `axe-playwright`'s floating
`^4.10.1`.** Its rule set _defines_ every count, so a Dependabot bump is _expected_
to move numbers: re-audit and re-baseline in that PR.

Reduced motion is centralized in the renderer motion tokens: under
`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, transitions and animations complete in 1 ms
and repeating animations run once. The nonzero duration preserves lifecycle
events used by dialog teardown. `tests/e2e/visual-accessibility.spec.ts` also
sets the real Electron page zoom to 200% and proves the shell, Settings, grid,
and Lightbox remain reachable without root-document horizontal scrolling. The
[manual visual-accessibility pass](./acceptance/Acceptance-Test-Visual-Accessibility.md)
covers physical OS settings and text-over-photo readability.

Re-baseline (this is how the audit was produced):

```sh
OVERLOOK_A11Y_REPORT=/tmp/a11y.jsonl npm run test:stories:ci   # JSONL, one line per story
```

The [July 2026 audit](./Accessibility-Audit-2026-07.md) records the baseline, the severity
ranking, the accepted exceptions, and — importantly — **what the automation cannot
see**. The [VoiceOver script](./acceptance/Manual-Test-A11y-VoiceOver.md) covers that half; axe detects
roughly a third of WCAG issues, so a green gate is not a claim of accessibility.

## Policy: coverage travels with the change

1. **Prefer the cheapest lane that proves the behavior.** Unit for logic; DOM
   for rendering; stories for component interaction;
   Playwright only for true end-to-end flows.
2. **Regression fixes ship with a failing-then-passing test** at the lane that
   would have caught the bug.
3. **Never lower a floor to pass.** c8 thresholds, type-coverage, and the
   file-size budget are ratchets: raise them as coverage improves, never lower
   them to merge.
4. **The acceptance coverage-map ledger is ACTIVE** (#82, per
   [ADR-0001](./adr/ADR-0001-Automation-Check-Governance.md)): every user-facing flow
   declares its coverage in `tests/e2e/coverage-map.json` — automated
   (`playwright-e2e` / `storybook` / `unit-dom` with paths), `manual` (with a
   reason), or `deferred` (with an issue). Two gates enforce it inside
   `npm run ci` and the CI job (`npm run check:acceptance-coverage`):
   `check-e2e-coverage-map.mjs` validates shape, path existence, and that
   every Playwright spec is mapped (deleting a mapped spec fails);
   `check-acceptance-coverage-diff.mjs` requires renderer `.ts/.tsx/.css`
   changes to touch the map — or carry a `no-acceptance-impact` token in the
   PR body/label when a change genuinely has no flow impact. The PR template
   carries the acceptance checkbox; the coverage-summary reporter renders the
   map distribution on each run. Each epic seeds its own entries.

## pCloud live contract run (owner-executed, never CI)

The provider contract suite also runs against **live pCloud** (#256, the
#109 epic) — env-gated so CI stays mock-only:

```sh
OVERLOOK_PCLOUD_LIVE=1 npm run test:pcloud:live
```

The suite prints a pCloud authorize URL; open it in a browser and approve.
The loopback listener captures the token itself (implicit flow — nothing to
copy) and the contract cases run against a scratch prefix under
`/Overlook/contract-scratch-<ulid>/`, cleaned up afterward. Requirements: a
browser session logged into the owner's pCloud account, and the registered
redirect (`http://127.0.0.1:41573/callback`) reachable — i.e. run it on a
machine, not a headless box. A green run is #109's exit criteria; record it
on the epic when it passes.

## iCloud Drive signed live contract (owner-executed, never CI)

Normal CI uses the deterministic iCloud authority. Live validation requires
the exact macOS ZIP from a manually dispatched **Package** workflow because the
app must be Developer ID signed, notarized, and provisioned for the production
iCloud Documents container. On a Mac signed in to iCloud Drive, extract the ZIP
and run:

```sh
OVERLOOK_ICLOUD_ARTIFACT_COMMIT=<workflow-head-sha> \
  npm run test:icloud:live -- /path/to/Overlook.app
```

The guarded command verifies signing/provisioning before launching a
packaged-only contract mode. It writes redacted evidence under `test-results/`
and removes only its generated library ULIDs. Apple Account material must never
enter Actions, logs, evidence, or the repository. Follow
[iCloud Drive acceptance](./acceptance/Manual-Test-iCloud-Drive.md).

## Command quick reference

```sh
npm run ci              # full local gate (mirrors CI's non-browser jobs)
npm run test            # typecheck + compile + unit and renderer DOM tests
npm run test:cov        # same under c8 with the coverage floor
npm run test:dom        # focused renderer DOM compile + tests
npm run coverage:summary# render totals vs. floor
npm run test:e2e        # Playwright (builds app via global-setup)
npm run test:e2e:ui     # Playwright UI mode
```
