# Localization Workflow

Overlook ships English (`en`) today. Its locale runtime, live switching, and
right-to-left layout support are ready for reviewed translations; adding a
shipping locale is intentionally a catalog change, not a second runtime.

The governing decisions are in
[ADR-0020](./adr/ADR-0020-Internationalization-Architecture.md). This page is
the contributor procedure.

## Add a Locale

1. Open an issue naming the locale and its native-language reviewer. A machine
   translation may seed a draft, but a native speaker must approve all copy
   before release.
2. Copy `src/shared/i18n/messages/en.json` to
   `src/shared/i18n/messages/<locale>.json` and translate message values. Keep
   message ids, ICU arguments, plural/select branches, and rich-text tags
   unchanged.
3. Add the locale to `SHIPPED_LOCALES` in
   `src/shared/i18n/locales.ts`. Add its base language to the RTL set there when
   the script reads right-to-left.
4. Run `npm run i18n:extract`. Resolve every missing or obsolete entry; do not
   copy untranslated English into the shipping catalog to silence the check.
5. Exercise the catalog from Storybook's locale toolbar. Use `en-XA` for long
   strings and `en-XB` for bidi/RTL layout before reviewing the real locale.
6. Run `npm run ci`, `npm run test:stories:ci`, and `npm run test:e2e` before
   requesting review.

## Review Checklist

- A native speaker reviews the complete catalog in the pull request and states
  that explicitly in the review.
- Destructive and irreversible actions receive a second, focused review:
  delete, purge, offload, restore, relock, and recovery-key/password warnings.
- Screenshots or Storybook evidence cover the settings, grid, lightbox,
  inspector, import, restore, and destructive-confirmation surfaces.
- Variable interpolation, plurals, dates, numbers, units, and relative times
  are checked with realistic values. Formatting stays in `Intl`; translated
  messages never assemble locale-sensitive values by string concatenation.
- RTL locales prove root `lang`/`dir`, sidebar placement, directional icons,
  lightbox key behavior, and unmirrored photographs.

## Update Existing Copy

Change the source message in code, run `npm run i18n:extract`, and update every
shipping catalog in the same pull request. A catalog mismatch is a failing
gate, not a fallback-to-English policy. Translator context belongs beside the
message definition so extraction preserves it.

Generated pseudo-locales are development and CI fixtures. Never add `en-XA` or
`en-XB` to `SHIPPED_LOCALES`, hand-edit their output, or expose them in release
settings.
