# Manual Test — VoiceOver (macOS)

> The screen-reader half of the accessibility gate. Automated axe checks
> ([Testing Strategy](../Testing-Strategy.md)) prove the a11y _tree_ is well-formed; they cannot
> prove a blind user can finish a task. This script does.

> NVDA parity is an explicit follow-up, not a silent omission.

> **Run it when:** a child of #381 lands a semantics change; before closing #381; and on

## Why this exists as a script and not a checklist

Most of the highest-severity findings in the
[July 2026 audit](../Accessibility-Audit-2026-07.md) — the Lightbox not being a dialog, toasts
taking their action away after 4s, the grid announcing "3 of 40" for a 40,000-photo
library — are **invisible to axe**. They are only findable by driving the app the way a
screen-reader user does. A checklist of attributes would have passed all three.

## Setup

1. Build and launch the seeded profile — a deterministic library, so counts are known:

   ```sh
   npm run seed:dev
   ```

2. Turn VoiceOver on: **⌘F5** (or Touch ID triple-press). **⌃⌥** is "VO" below.
3. **VO+U** opens the rotor; **⌃⌥←/→** move by element; **VO+Space** activates.
4. Open the Web Item rotor with **VO+U** and check **Landmarks** and **Headings** — the
   first two tests read those lists directly.
5. Turn the **screen off**, or look away, for tests 3–7. If you can see the app you will
   unconsciously compensate and the test is worthless.

Record results as **pass / fail / partial** with the announcement **verbatim** — the exact
string is the evidence, and paraphrase loses the defect.

## Tests

### 1. Landmarks — can you orient?

**VO+U → Landmarks.**

- **Expect:** a landmark for each region — banner (title bar), navigation ("Library"),
  the toolbar, main, complementary ("Inspector") when open, contentinfo (status bar).
- **Known fail** (audit finding 15, [#400](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/400)):
  the **toolbar is in no landmark** — search, filters, view toggle, and zoom are
  unreachable by landmark navigation. There is also **no skip link** (2.4.1).

### 2. Headings — is there an outline?

**VO+U → Headings.**

- **Expect:** an `h1` naming the view, and headings for Sidebar groups
  (Library / Albums / Protected) and Inspector sections.
- **Known fail** (finding 16): the shell has **no `h1`** and those headings are `<div>`s.
  Expect a near-empty list. `SettingsDialog` has an `h3` with nothing above it.

### 3. Browse the grid — is the count true?

Tab into the grid, then **⌃⌥→** through tiles.

- **Expect:** each photo announces its position in the **whole library** ("3 of 1,204").
- **Known fail** (finding 3, [#399](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/399)): the grid
  is virtualized with no `aria-setsize`/`aria-posinset`/`aria-rowcount`, so it announces
  the count of _mounted_ tiles — **actively wrong**, not merely missing.
- Also check: is there any way **past** the grid without tabbing every tile? (No.)
- On a tile, press **Space**. **Known fail** (finding 9,
  [#412](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/412)): only Enter works.
- Listen for the select circle's name and pressed state. **Known fail:** it is nested
  inside `role="button"`, so it may be discarded entirely.

### 4. Select photos — is the selection announced?

**⌘A**, then select and deselect individual photos.

- **Expect:** the selection count is announced as it changes.
- **Known fail** (finding 12, [#400](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/400)): the
  SelectionPill appears with no live region — **silence**.
- Reach the pill's overflow menu by keyboard. **Known fail** (finding 22): `role="menu"`
  with no focus management, no arrow keys, no Escape.
- Note: ⌘A selects only the **loaded page**, not the library. Compare what was announced
  against the status bar's total.

### 5. Open the Lightbox — the modal test

Enter on a tile.

- **Expect:** focus moves into the overlay; it is announced as a dialog; the shell behind
  it is unreachable; Escape returns focus **to the tile you came from**.
- **Known fail** (findings 1, 2, [#399](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/399)):
  it is **not a dialog** — no trap, no `aria-modal`, no restore. Navigate with the
  **virtual cursor (VO+→)** past the overlay: you will read the entire shell underneath.
  This is the test that catches it; Tab alone does not.
- Wait **3 seconds without touching the mouse**, then try to reach the controls by
  keyboard. **Known fail:** chrome hides on mouse-idle with no keyboard wake path.
- Step with ←/→ — is the new photo announced at all?
- On an offloaded photo, watch the custody strip (`FETCHING ORIGINAL…` →
  `STREAMING ORIGINAL…`). **Known fail:** a security-relevant state machine with no live
  region.

### 6. Import — is progress audible?

Open Import, choose a folder, run it.

- **Expect:** phase changes and completion are announced; failures are announced
  assertively.
- **Known fail** (finding 12): both progress bars are silent; only the **failure** summary
  has `role="alert"`, so **success is silent**.
- Insert an SD card mid-dialog: the `Looking for cards…` → detected transition is silent.
- Find the "Generate thumbnails on import" checkbox: it is `checked` with no `onChange`
  and is not disabled — it cannot be changed and does not say so.

### 7. Toasts — can you reach the action?

Trigger an operation that toasts with an action (an import completion, or a failed backup
with "Retry").

- **Expect:** the toast is announced; the action is reachable and activatable.
- **Known fail** (finding 5, [#411](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/411)): it
  auto-dismisses after **4 seconds**, taking the action with it. Time it: from the end of
  the announcement, can you tab to the button before it vanishes? Record how long the
  announcement itself takes — that is the argument.
- Also: the toast mounts _with_ `role="status"` rather than living as a persistent region,
  so the announcement may not fire at all. Try several times; intermittency is the symptom.

### 8. Dialogs — does focus come back?

Open Settings, tab around, close with Escape.

- **Expect:** focus returns to the gear button.
- **Known fail** (finding 10, [#399](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/399)): focus
  drops to `<body>` — you are dumped at the top of the document. Repeat for Export,
  Offload, and Key.
- With Settings open, use the **virtual cursor** to read behind the scrim.
  **Known fail** (finding 11): nothing is `inert`/`aria-hidden`.
- Navigate the Settings section nav with **arrow keys**. **Known fail** (finding 21): it
  is a tab pattern with no tab semantics.

### 9. Lock and protected surfaces — accessible _and_ fail-closed

Lock the app (⌘L or Settings → Privacy).

- **Expect:** `h1` announced, password field named, errors announced politely.
  This surface is the **best** in the app — it should largely pass.
- Enter a wrong password 5× to trigger the throttle. **Known fail** (finding 26): the
  countdown re-announces the focused button ~4×/sec. The throttle **itself** is an
  [accepted exception](../Accessibility-Audit-2026-07.md#accepted-exceptions) (2.2.1 Essential).
- Open a protected album, then relock. **Known fail:** focus lands on `<body>` with no
  announcement that the view was torn down.
- **Critically:** confirm nothing about protected content leaks into the a11y tree while
  locked. Fail-closed **and** accessible ([#305](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/305)).
  A leak here is a security bug, not an a11y bug — escalate it as one.

### 10. Shortcut conflicts

With VoiceOver on, open a dialog **not** in `use-global-keys`' list (Offload, Key, or
Interop) and press **`i`**.

- **Known fail** (finding 23, [#399](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/399)): the
  inspector toggles _behind_ the dialog. `anyDialogOpen` tracks 3 of ~11 dialogs.
- Type `i` into any password field and confirm the inspector does **not** toggle (the
  `inField` guard covers `input`, so this should pass).
- Note for 2.1.4 (finding 14): `i`, `+`, `-`, `0` are unmodified single-key shortcuts and
  are not remappable or disableable — a **Level A** failure regardless of this test's
  outcome.

## Reporting

- File each **new** finding as its own issue, severity-ranked, linked to
  [#381](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/381), and add it to the
  [audit report](../Accessibility-Audit-2026-07.md).
- For a **known** finding, confirming it still reproduces is the useful output — note it
  on the owning issue with the verbatim announcement.
- If a known fail now **passes**, say so on the issue: that is a fix landing, and the
  corresponding `tests/a11y/violation-budget.json` entry should be shrinking too.
- Record the run (date, macOS + VoiceOver version, commit SHA) on the issue that prompted
  it. VoiceOver behaviour changes across macOS releases; an undated pass is not evidence.
