# Original Preservation Policy

Issue [#482](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/482) adds an **Original**
classification to ordinary-library photos. It is a user-declared preservation
marker, not a file-format label, custody state, or proof that a blob is a camera
source file.

## User contract

- A marked photo displays an Original badge in gallery, list, and Inspector
  surfaces.
- Normal deletion, Trash purge, and retention cleanup preserve Originals and
  report how many items were protected.
- Shift+Delete is the explicit override. A configured app password must be
  re-authenticated before the final irreversible confirmation.
- The authorization is short-lived, one-use, and bound to the active library,
  lock session, selected IDs, and their Original classifications. Any stale
  state restarts the ceremony.
- The marker is backup-relevant metadata and survives encrypted backup and
  disaster recovery. Older manifests without the field restore as unmarked.

## Duplicate boundary

Detection is deliberately outside this feature. Candidate consumers call
`duplicatePairEligible` after discovery and before storing, grouping, or
presenting a pair:

| Left         | Right        | Eligible |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------- |
| Original     | Original     | yes      |
| Original     | non-Original | no       |
| non-Original | Original     | no       |
| non-Original | non-Original | yes      |

Changing the marker emits the affected photo IDs through the targeted
`originalClassificationChanged` event so future duplicate indexes can
invalidate only those candidates.

## Custody invariants

- `photos.content_hash` remains unique.
- Import continues suppressing an exact plaintext hash before encryption.
- Separate photo IDs never share encrypted blob custody.
- The policy creates no perceptual fingerprints, duplicate scanner, result
  store, or automatic merge/delete behavior. Perceptual review belongs to
  [#650](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/650).
- Sidecar-based non-destructive variants belong to
  [#496](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/496) and reference one owning
  Original rather than duplicating its blob custody.

Protected albums remain a separate encrypted custody domain; this ordinary
library classification does not alter their schema or migration protocol.
