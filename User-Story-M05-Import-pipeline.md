# M05: Import pipeline

**Epic:** [#40](https://github.com/qwts/photos/issues/40) · **Lane:** Lane B — Core

Lane B. Real import from an SD card or folder: volume detection with new-vs-total counting, EXIF extraction, thumbnail generation (RAW via embedded preview for v1), copy-or-move semantics (**Move deletes from source only after verified import** — the design shows an inline amber warning), encrypt-on-import (always on), all with the per-stage progress the ImportDialog renders (copy+encrypt bar, thumbnails bar, mono `n / total` counts).

## Issues

## Acceptance coverage

| Flow | Status | Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source discovery + scan (volumes, allowlist, SHA-256 dedupe, progressive counts) | ✅ #84 (PR #174) | `tests/import/source-scanner.test.ts` |
| EXIF extraction (never-fabricate, RAF embedded preview, floating wall-clock takenAt) | ✅ #85 (PR #176) | `tests/import/exif.test.ts` |
| Thumbnail worker pool (sharp WebP derivatives, metadata stripped, crash-safe, encrypted at rest) | ✅ #86 (PR #182) | `tests/import/thumbnail-pool.test.ts` |
| Import engine (journal resume, per-file Move verify-then-delete, dual progress, serialization) | ✅ #87 (PR #183) | `tests/import/import-engine*.test.ts` (kill-test matrix + real-store integration w/ orphan scan) |
| ImportDialog options/running/done, verbatim copy + Move warning | ✅ #88 (PR #184) | `ImportDialog.stories.tsx` play tests + `tests/e2e/import-flow.spec.ts` — ledger id `m05-import-dialog` |
| Completion toast (exact counts, Show action, 4s dismiss) + Recent imports jump | ✅ #89 (PR #185) | `tests/library/app-state.test.ts` + `tests/e2e/import-flow.spec.ts` — ledger id `m05-recent-imports-toast` |
| Full path in CI: fixture card in → encrypted library out (no-plaintext scan, Move source emptied post-verification, Cancel semantics) | ✅ #90 (PR #186) | `tests/e2e/import-flow.spec.ts` |

Notable: the #90 E2E caught a real fresh-profile bug (photos.key_id FK row only written by the dev seed) — fixed in library bootstrap.
